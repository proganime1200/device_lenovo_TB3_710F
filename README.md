# device_lenovo_TB3_710F
device directory for building custom rom for Lenovo TAB3 Essential 710F (wifi&amp;gps only) 

This repo is a kind of sandbox for me to contribute to custom rom building for this device. 
The source is the cm-12.1 branch of https://github.com/andrew264/android_device_lenovo_TB3_710F modified upon the working source of https://github.com/Cyanogenmod-for-Lenovo-Tab2A7-10F/android_device_lenovo_Tab2A710F

some updates from Tab2A710F were added...
libxlog, configs, downgrade(?) of wpa_supplicant still needed
